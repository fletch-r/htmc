# HTMC

This tool is for merging HTML files by replacing elements in the `index.html` file that contain a path attribute with the contents of another HTML file using the path that is given in the path attribute.

##Â Usage
To use the tool, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```console
$ cargo run
```

This will merge the contents of `merge.html` into `index.html`, replacing any element in `index.html` that has a path attribute with the contents of the corresponding element in `merge.html`.

This will replace any elements in the `index.html` that contain a `path=""` attribute with the contents of the file given in the path attribute.

## Example

Suppose you have an index.html file that looks like this:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div path="./header.html"></div>
    <div path="../content/content.html"></div>
    <div path="../footer/footer.html"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

And you have the following `header.html`, `content.html`, and `footer.html` files:

```html
<!-- header.html -->
<header>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
</header>

<!-- content.html -->
<main>
  <p>This is the main content of my website.</p>
</main>

<!-- footer.html -->
<footer>
  <p>&copy; 2023 My Company, Inc.</p>
</footer>
```

This will replace the div elements in `index.html` with the contents of the corresponding HTML files, resulting in a merged `index.html` file that looks like this:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <p>This is the main content of my website.</p>
    </main>
    <footer>
      <p>&copy; 2023 My Company, Inc.</p>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```
